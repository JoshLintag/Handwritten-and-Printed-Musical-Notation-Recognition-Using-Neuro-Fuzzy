# Handwritten-and-Printed-Musical-Notation-Recognition-Using-Neuro-Fuzzy
Undergraduate Thesis


From the earlier times until today, sheet music has always been an integral part of a
musician or a composer’s life, whether that individual is a professional, a student, or an
enthusiast, they would always write their sheet music onto paper. These papers would
either be lost, destroyed, or in the case of non digital copies, would need adjustments on
spot. There are also some paper that are not comprehensible to other people because
of the way a musician or composer would write their own versions, each of them having
their own writing styles for different kinds of musical notations. After long advancements
of technology mostly from Optical Characte Recognition, Optical Music Recognition was
developed in order to be of great help for these musicians. Although Optical Music
Recognition is efficient in recognizing handwritten or printed sheet music, the methods
and algorithms used for it barely scratched the surface of OMR. This research and study
is aimed to help Optical Music Recognition by classifying both handwritten and printed
musical notation using a Concurrent Neuro-Fuzzy System which is a Neural Network that
works alongside Fuzzy Logic.
